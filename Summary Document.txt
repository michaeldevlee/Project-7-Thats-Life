Art
- understood shading a little bit more with plants
- highlights are best represented on the edges of leaves
- I should have focused on the art more, mingled too much with
the programming part of things
- 640 x 360 is great resolution for detailed but noticable pixel art
- 320 x 180 is great for simple art
- shading in pixel art gives illusion of depth and looks like the darker part
is angled more towards the page
- highlights make the art pop out and give it more hints of form
- too much contrast gives it an amateur look

Programming
- Had a little trouble setting up the flip mechanic but learned
there was a property which can be set true or false
- Had trouble with movement in the beginning. Setting the Vector2()
variable still confuses me. Is it referring to the Vector2() of the
attached Node or is it just a declared value?
- When setting up movement and jump animations, I always have trouble
setting up when the animations would play. I could always just copy
what I have done before and be done with it. Don't waste time trying
to reinvent the wheel (is_on_floor() is always returning false for some reason
and I have no idea why, I set up the collisions correctly and both bodies are
on the same layer)
- reminded of passing in parameters into functions to dynamically manipulate
stuff
- Always consider the middle of the sprite when considering position of sprites
in the viewport
